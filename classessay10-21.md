The topic heading that I decided to observe was “Increasing Learning & LIteracy”. The first graph displayed the projection of the total world population by level of education from 1970 to 2100. It suggests that the number of people that reach a level of “Upper Secondary” or “Post Secondary” level of education will greatly increase whereas lower levels of education such as “Lower Secondary”, “Primary”, “Incomplete Primary”, and “No Education” will gradually decrease, or at least become less of a percentage of the population. I think that this graph shows a sign of progress, since it is suggesting that the world is improving in levels of education. The second graph shows the population of the world and the amount of literate and illiterate people, from 1800 to 2014. It shows how the literate population rose from just over 10% in 1800 to around 85% in 2014. I think this graph clearly shows that quality progress has been made, as the ability to read and write is essential in effectively sharing knowledge and ideas. The third graph illustrates the decline of child labor from 2000 to 2012, and then based on the values of these years, provides a predicted decline from 2012 to 2020. The fourth graph is comparing the average years of education from 1820 to 2003 of the USA, UK, Japan, France, India, and China. Every country has steadily increased in number of years. In the fifth graph, literacy rates are shown for the Netherlands, Great Britain, Sweden, Germany, France, Italy, Ireland, Belgium, Spain, Poland, Russia, USA, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Peru. The graph’s x-axis goes from 1475 to 2003, and demonstrates how the world as a whole has gradually increased literacy rates. The sixth graph displays the percentage of illiteracy in the US of both minorities and white populations, as well as the total population. From 1900 to 2000, the illiteracy rate has decreased, the minority population in particular, to the point where both minority and white populations had an illiteracy rate of close to 0%. The seventh graph showed the percent of population aged 25 and over of different levels of education, “Less Than High School”, “High School or Some College”, and “Bachelor’s Degree or Higher”. As time progressed from 1940 to 2012, “Less Than High School” decreased greatly, and “High School or Some College” and “Bachelor’s Degree or Higher” increased. In the eighth graph, the years of education per person from 1820 to 1970 of the USA, Japan, France, UK, India, and China are shown. Each country has experienced a rise in the average number of years of education. In the ninth graph, the percentage of illiterate vs. literate of the world population is shown, and reveals how illiteracy has been declining whereas literacy has increased. The tenth graph demonstrates the average number of years of schooling across all education levels for the US, South Korea, China, Iraq, India, Haiti, and Democratic Republic of Congo. As time progressed, the average of each country rose. The eleventh graph provides insight on the literacy rate of France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, UK, US, Argentina, Brazil, and the World and shows how the general trend of literacy rates is positive. I think that all of these graphs and trends are good indicators that progress has been made in the world. The improvements in education are shown in the improving literacy rates, declining illiteracy rates, increasing number of higher levels of education, and more. In regards to Dan and Amartya Sen, there are a number of barriers to progress that could be present that limit the progress of learning and literacy. The first thought that came to mind was the political stability of a country. The influence of politics and government can greatly impact the ability for people both young and old to access education. A country might not be able to financially support quality education establishments and enforce standards of education that would in turn lead to less opportunities for people. Another barrier to improving education is economic freedom. I would think that this is one of the most prominent issues that contribute to a slower progression of education. In many cases, people are unable to pursue higher forms of education or any education at all due to not having the necessary money and/or having to work in order to support themselves and their families.
