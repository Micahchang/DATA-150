This presentation will discuss the issues found within accessible healthcare in Nigeria. The ability to travel to a healthcare facility to receive medical attention or simply having an option of going to a healthcare facility is dependent on numerous factors. Less favorable conditions that give rise to a greater difficulty in accessing healthcare will significantly diminish the quality of life. This presentation will also discuss the utilization of geospatial techniques through the use of mobile phone data and logistic regression models through the use of data from the Nigerian Demographic and Health Survey. This presentation will identify economic stress as an area that needs further investigation. Health insurance is severely absent in Nigeria, and high hospital fees would discourage people from traveling to healthcare facilities. The research question can then be adjusted to reflect that the issue of receiving healthcare is influenced more by a personâ€™s decision rather than simply their ability to travel to a healthcare facility. The presentation will then propose a research plan exploring factors such as financial hardships and how they influence whether a person will decide to receive healthcare or not.
