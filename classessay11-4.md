I don’t have much previous knowledge of data science and human development. However, I am interested in the ethical and moral dilemmas behind different forms of data collection found in data science and big data. For example, maybe some videos or readings on data collection from smart phones or social media apps. I don’t have any specific video or readings in mind, but that could be interesting. I know that we looked into readings regarding ethical issues near the beginning of the semester, but we didn’t go over that much. I am also interested in cameras and AI face recognition, and the level of privacy and honesty between companies and consumers.
