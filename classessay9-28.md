- I'd like to get to know you better. What is your general background---in a few sentences, what do you want me to know about you? What are your interests academically, intellectually, or professionally? Basically, what do you care about (no wrong answers here)? What do you think data science is? Based on your conception of data science, in a very broad sense, how (if at all) do you think it can be harnessed to improve the lives of people (their quality of life), the environment, our understanding of ourselves or nature, business & economics, everyday problem solving, or anything else?

My name is Micah Chang. My mom is from China and my dad is from Korea, but I was born and raised in the United States. I have a younger brother, as well as a dog (labradoodle). I am completely undecided on a major, but have interests in areas like business, psychology, sociology, and data science. In my free time, I like to watch basketball and look at the many different statistics used within basketball, although I also enjoy looking at and evaluating statistics of many other sports. Besides sports statistics, I have interests in things such as music, video games, photography, interconnectedness of social issues, and cultural identity, to name a few.

I think of data science as the collection of large amounts of information on a subject. With that knowledge, data scientists can then analyse and evaluate the issues of that particular population and place to hopefully come up with solutions or improvements that will improve the quality of life of the people. This can be done by putting data through algorithms, comparing with other sets of data, and collaborating with people of other expertise. I think the use of data science will be most effective when the collaboration between data scientists and people with the ability to influence change in that specific location is strong. By combining the knowledge of data scientists with the social understanding and awareness of the people knowledgeable of that area, data science has the most opportunity to create positive change and significantly improve the quality of life and wellbeing of the people in that area.
