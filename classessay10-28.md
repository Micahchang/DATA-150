I believe that the title of “data scientist” should be designated for those with doctoral degrees, because there is so much understanding and expertise that is expected of a data scientist. By reserving “data scientist” to those with doctoral degrees, hopefully more people will begin to realize the rising importance and potential of data science as a whole and to not underestimate data science. 

I am considering a major within business, and know that data science has already started to become integrated. For example, data has already been collected for a long time on people so that companies can determine the demographics of customers, and thus be able to analyze their own market audiences, appropriate marketing strategies, and more. Data science is also present when companies are gathering financial information on themselves and attempting to predict future trends and potential issues and/or success. They also could attempt to find areas of concern, and where they can fix problems that would help improve profits. By using quantitative data from a company’s financial statements or balance sheets, for example, a company could use data science to understand trends and possibly predict future revenue or some other values that would provide insight on the decisions that the company is contemplating at the moment. Data science and machine learning could be used to predict trends in consumer behavior or consumer culture and help companies get an idea of how they might want to shift policies or strategies in order to most effectively reach and sell to prospective consumers.
