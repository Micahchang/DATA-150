I think that the development and adoption of self-driving vehicle technology is a greater indication of the rising usage and potential of AI in our everyday lives. Self-driving vehicle technology specifically has several positive and negative aspects that should be really important to think about. They are able to provide transportation for people that are tired or in a state where it is unsafe for them to drive. They could also provide transportation for those that may be physically impossible for them to drive a vehicle. The aspect of AI could eliminate human error and potentially limit the number of car accidents, or potentially decrease the fatality of such accidents. However, issues such as the dilemma of the job loss of many people that rely on driving arises. These would include jobs such as truckers, cab drivers, and services such as Uber or Lyft.

The various aspects of self-driving vehicle technology are applicable to many other forms of AI. The overall benefits of AI are often said to include things such as making tasks easier for humans or making them safer and of better quality. AI could potentially make results more consistent with the elimination or decrease of human involvement and thus human error. However, there are several negatives that people point out when pushing back against the rise of AI. One of the most popular being that AI would be replacing humans and consequently leading to the job loss of millions of people.
